# üé® Neural Style Transfer (NST) in PyTorch

This project implements **Neural Style Transfer** using PyTorch, allowing you to apply the artistic style of one image to another. It‚Äôs based on the seminal paper *"A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"* by Gatys et al.



## üß† What is Neural Style Transfer?

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that blends two images:
- **Content Image**: The image you want to apply the style to.
- **Style Image**: The artistic image whose style you want to use.

NST generates a new image that maintains the structure of the content image but adopts the style (colors, brushstrokes, textures) of the style image.



## üìÅ Project Structure







## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Install dependencies using pip:

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib pillow

To use the CPU version of PyTorch (recommended if you don‚Äôt have CUDA):

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

How to Run

1.Place your content.jpg and style.jpg in the project folder.

2.Run the script:

python NST.py

3.The output will be displayed using matplotlib.

4.The final image is a fusion of the two: the structure of the content with the texture of the style.

Customization

Change the style_weight and content_weight in the script to adjust the intensity of the style.

Modify the image paths to use your own photos.
