# NEURAL-STYLE-TRANSFER

# 🎨 Neural Style Transfer (NST) in PyTorch

This project implements **Neural Style Transfer** using PyTorch, allowing you to apply the artistic style of one image to another. It’s based on the seminal paper *"A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"* by Gatys et al.

## 🧠 What is Neural Style Transfer?

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that blends two images:
- **Content Image**: The image you want to apply the style to.
- **Style Image**: The artistic image whose style you want to use.

NST generates a new image that maintains the structure of the content image but adopts the style (colors, brushstrokes, textures) of the style image.
